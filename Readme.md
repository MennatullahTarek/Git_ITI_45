## What This Repository Covers

1. **Creating Repositories**  
   - Start with a local repository.  
   - Link it to a remote repository on GitHub.

2. **Adding and Pushing Files**  
   - Add files like:  
     - `demo.py` (to practice pushing Python files).  
     - `mena.txt` (to practice pushing text files).  
   - Learn how to reset, restore, and re-add files with `new.txt`.
   - Push a **folder** called `Test` to practice working with folders in Git.

3. **Working with Branches**  
   - Create a new branch called `new-branch`.  
   - Add a file (`new branch.txt`) in this branch.  
   - Merge it back into the main branch.

4. **Using Tags**  
   - Create a lightweight tag (`v1.0`).  
   - Create an annotated tag (`v2.0`). <br>
   
   - **Difference Between Lightweight and Annotated Tags**
     - `Lightweight Tags`: These types of tags are just pointers to a commit without any other additional metadata. They are super quick and uncomplicated to create but they do not keep any extra details.
     - `Annotated Tags`: They are full objects within the Git database that save information such as the taggerâ€™s name, email address, date of creation and a tagging message. These tags contain more information and are often used for public-release versions.
